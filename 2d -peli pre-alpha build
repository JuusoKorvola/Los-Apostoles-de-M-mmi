NOTE: this could be a pre-pre alpha build of the game, where basic mechanics and sprites are tested.

Build notes:
- Created a collidable world, with a movable character. 
- Created collision boxes where character can jump on and from.
- Created objects with a killzone feature
        - Killzone returns the player to the start of the map. Goal is to avoid killzones and finish the game at the top 
- Added a skybox to test out sprites.
